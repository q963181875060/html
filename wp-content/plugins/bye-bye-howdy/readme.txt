Get rid of "Hodwy" and the often unnecessary "My Account" drop-down menu and replace it with two simple top-level links.

== Description ==

By default, the WordPress admin bar includes a user menu in the right top corner, starting with the well-known "Hodwy [username]" and giving access to the profile page and the logout link.
When using WordPress as a CMS, however, there is no real need for all this profile related stuff and one might prefer a simple, directly available logout link.
This plugin gives you exactly that. It replaces the "Howdy" text in English language versions of WordPress with "Hello", removes the underlying profile menu and adds a simple, directly available log-out link.

== Installation ==

1. Go to your admin area and select Plugins -> Add new from the menu.
2. Search for "Bye Bye Howdy".
3. Click install.
4. Click activate.

== Screenshots ==

1. Screenshot of the admin bar with plugin enabled in the desktop view.
2. Screenshot of the admin bar with plugin enabled in the mobile view.
